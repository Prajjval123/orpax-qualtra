Full-stack developers are the technology experts and their know-how of different technologies makes it possible to bring an enterprise-level application to the market as quickly as possible. Full-stack development makes it very straightforward to adapt to changing requirements as the engineer understands the complete flow of your application. This also includes the integration of various third-party services like payment gateways, social networks, business analytics, search engine optimization tools. Our services include all types of frameworks and tools such as MEAN and MERN stack as well as .NET Stack. Full-stack development is critical in case you want to develop and deploy your application faster. We specialize in full range technologies which include front-end prototyping to back-end services. While developing the front-end we make sure that the best SEO practices are also taken care of by default. We have experts who create RESTful APIs and specializes in microservices. All this goes hand in hand with the best practices of cloud computing to deploy the applications once the development is completed. Another important aspect when it comes to modern-day web applications is that they are responsive to all screen sizes. We make sure this by keeping our approach to be mobile-first. We deliver a superior user experience by following agile methodology. We follow the best development and coding practices to make sure that the code we have written is highly optimized. Also, the back-end we develop for your application would be highly secure, stable, and easily scalable. We make sure that we have multi-layered security protocols between the services and the database. We sit with you to understand the business logic, which is the heart of any application, and we make sure that our solution is centred around this logic. We craft a front-end that is easy to use and beautifully blended with a back-end that is secure, stable, and fast. We have robust QA protocols in place to make sure that there are no production defects leaking.

The system stores data on various objects in the space, and enables reviewing, analysis or data updating, if possible. The system enables the visualization of objects in the space on the appropriate cartographic substrates.We in ORPAX recognized the importance of GIS mapping, as this advanced system found its application in numerous fields of industry and science.Namely, the increased requirements regarding information management and database linking of various geographic locations has created an enhanced necessity for GIS mapping. As more and more organizations venture into this novel technology system, there are many benefits of a vastly improved management of organization resourcesGIS has the capability of linking data sets in order of geographical locations and, therefore, the system facilitates the sharing of inter-department communication and information which in turn leads to better productivityGIS mapping is among the first steps in this process. It is a procedure of collecting data about objects in the space, which necessarily involves recording the geographical position of the object (x and y coordinates)This is why GIS mapping is a very important aspect of GIS that we at ORPAX invest in. Today, we have the resources required to provide a fully automated service for all types of projects that require modern GIS analysis and software tools. Technology on its own has no great value if you don’t have skilled and knowledgeable human resources to put it into practical use, manage and develop it. At ORPAX, we are not only dedicated to GIS mapping, but to people who can apply these solutions to real-world situations. Our dedicated and highly competent team of experts has achieved breakthrough innovations in implementing GIS mapping with aim of integrating spatial data and other data resources and preparing for the phase of GIS digitization.",
